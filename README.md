# crunch-gui
 A tool to use crunch with a graphical user interface

Depends on [crunch by ChevyRay](https://github.com/ChevyRay/crunch/) to work, you need to build it and put the `crunch.exe` file in the app folder. (To build it it with VS 2017 and higher, you can use [this repo](https://github.com/fountainment/crunch))

Functionalities:

- Support all the functionalities of crunch (except the verbose mode)
- Create batch files to build your images with a double click (like you should normally do when using only crunch)
- Create configuration files to save your selected options & sources

TODO:

- Support verbose mode
- Option to create relatives path batch files
